## 🌌 What is VM0?

AI development today is held back by two outdated models:

- 🧱 **Container runners** — traditional tech stack 
- 🔗 **Workflow builders** — rigid, brittle, not agent-native  

Agents require a fundamentally different environment.

**VM0 is the runtime purpose-built for agents.**  
No workflows. No black-box containers. Just a clean, persistent, observable place for agents to live, think, and evolve.

---

## ⚡ Build agents the modern way

### ✨ Natural-language powered  
Write a prompt or a simple config file — your agent is ready.  
No drag-and-drop. No pipelines.

### 🔧 Works with all CLI-based agents  
VM0 supports the new wave of developer-native agent CLIs:

- Claude Code  
- OpenAI Codex  
- Gemini CLI  
- Cursor CLI  
- Any custom CLI agent  

VM0 integrates seamlessly into your development environment.

## 🤖 Agent templates

| Agent Type | What It Can Do |
|------------|----------------|
| **Marketing Agent** | Explore variations, run tasks, refine campaigns safely |
| **Productivity Agent** | Execute actions and routines with zero risk to production |
| **Research Agent** | Gather, analyze, and iterate in an isolated workspace |
| **Coding Agent** | Execute code, use terminal, access the web — securely |
| **Much more** | ... |



## 🧠 Purpose-built for agents

### 🚫 No workflows  
It can be simple as just one prompt.
VM0 handles the lifecycle, state, and environment.

### 🧬 True agent runtime  
VM0 understands agents as:

- Stateful  
- Iterative  
- Contextual  
- Long-lived  

It preserves their **sessions**, **memory**, and **reasoning context**.

### 🔍 Observable by design  
Every run surfaces:

- Logs  
- Metrics  
- Tool calls  
- Token traces  

No more guessing what happened inside a container.

### ♻️ Reproducible & persistent  
Each run creates a **checkpoint snapshot** you can:

- Restore  
- Replay  
- Fork  
- Optimize  

Agents keep their memory.  
Developers keep control.

---

## 🏗️ Infrastructure features

### 📦 Versioned artifact storage  
Automatic syncing between sandbox and cloud storage, prewarmed before runtime.

### 🔄 Session continuity  
CLI agent sessions persist across runs — unaffected by container lifetimes.

### 📊 Structured observability  
Stream everything through a clean API or dashboard.

### 🎞️ Checkpoint & replay  
Every run is a snapshot in time. Reattach or improve it anytime.
