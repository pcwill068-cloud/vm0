## Summary

Removed event batching logic to provide real-time event delivery.

## Code Quality Assessment

### Good Practices ✅

1. **Simplification** ✅ - Removes batching complexity
2. **Real-time delivery** ✅ - Better user experience
3. **YAGNI** ✅ - Removes unnecessary batching

### Changes Made

- Removed BATCH_SIZE, BATCH_INTERVAL configuration
- Removed batch state variables
- Simplified to immediate event sending

## Issues Found

### Potential Concern: No Rate Limiting

**Severity:** Low

With immediate sending, high-frequency events could overwhelm the API.

**Recommendation:**

- Monitor for API rate limit issues
- Consider throttling if events fire very frequently
- Document expected event frequency

## Overall Assessment

**Quality:** Good ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Risk Level:** Low ✅

Good simplification. Just monitor for potential rate limiting issues.
