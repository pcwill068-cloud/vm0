**PR:** #57
**Title:** fix: update webhook sequence numbers to use integer type

## Summary of Changes

This commit updates the webhook agent events endpoint to handle sequence numbers as integers instead of strings, aligning with a database schema change from PR #55. The changes include:

1. **API Route (`route.ts`)**: Modified sequence number handling to use integer type
   - Removed string parsing logic: changed `parseInt(lastEvent.maxSeq, 10)` to direct integer usage
   - Removed string conversion: changed `String(lastSequence + index + 1)` to direct integer arithmetic
   - Used nullish coalescing operator (`??`) instead of ternary operator for cleaner default value

2. **Test File (`webhooks.test.ts`)**: Updated test assertions
   - Changed expected sequence numbers from string (`"1"`, `"2"`) to integer (`1`, `2`)

3. **Test Configuration (`vitest.config.ts`)**: Added database safety measure
   - Set `fileParallelism: false` to prevent database race conditions

## Analysis by Bad Code Smell Categories

### 1. Mock Analysis ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** No new mocks introduced
- **Assessment:** The changes maintain the existing test structure without adding unnecessary mocking

### 2. Test Coverage ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** Existing tests properly updated to match implementation changes
- **Assessment:** Tests verify the correct behavior of sequence number handling as integers
- **Note:** The tests appropriately check both sequence number values and ordering

### 3. Error Handling ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** No try/catch blocks added
- **Assessment:** Code maintains fail-fast approach, letting errors propagate naturally
- **Note:** Removal of `parseInt()` eliminates potential NaN handling complexity

### 4. Interface Changes ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** Type change in data layer (string → integer for sequenceNumber)
- **Assessment:** This is a breaking change, but properly documented in commit message
- **Documentation:** Commit clearly states alignment with schema change in PR #55

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** No timers, delays, or fake timers introduced
- **Assessment:** Code changes are synchronous and deterministic

### 6. Prohibition of Dynamic Imports ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** No dynamic imports present
- **Assessment:** All imports remain static

### 7. Database and Service Mocking in Web Tests ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** Tests continue to use real database connections
- **Assessment:** No mocking of `globalThis.services` or database operations
- **Note:** The addition of `fileParallelism: false` indicates proper use of real database in tests

### 8. Test Mock Cleanup ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** No new mock usage that requires cleanup
- **Assessment:** Existing test structure appears to handle mocks properly (not visible in diff)

### 9. TypeScript `any` Type Usage ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** No `any` types introduced
- **Assessment:** Code maintains strict typing throughout

### 10. Artificial Delays in Tests ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** No artificial delays added
- **Assessment:** Tests rely on natural async/await patterns

### 11. Hardcoded URLs and Configuration ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** No hardcoded URLs or configuration values
- **Assessment:** Changes are purely type-related, no configuration added

### 12. Direct Database Operations in Tests ⚠️ MINOR CONCERN

- **Finding:** Tests use direct database queries to verify results
- **Code Example:**
  ```typescript
  const events = await db
    .select()
    .from(agentRuntimeEvents)
    .where(eq(agentRuntimeEvents.runtimeId, runtimeId))
    .orderBy(agentRuntimeEvents.sequenceNumber);
  ```
- **Assessment:** This is acceptable for verifying webhook data storage since there's no API endpoint to retrieve these events yet
- **Recommendation:** If a GET endpoint is added for retrieving agent events, tests should be refactored to use it

### 13. Avoid Fallback Patterns - Fail Fast ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** Improved fail-fast behavior
- **Assessment:** The change from `lastEvent?.maxSeq ? parseInt(lastEvent.maxSeq, 10) : 0` to `lastEvent?.maxSeq ?? 0` is cleaner
- **Note:** Uses nullish coalescing which provides appropriate default without hiding errors

### 14. Prohibition of Lint/Type Suppressions ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** No suppression comments added
- **Assessment:** All changes follow proper TypeScript and linting standards

### 15. Avoid Bad Tests ✅ PASS

- **Finding:** Tests are meaningful and verify actual behavior
- **Assessment:**
  - Tests verify real database state after webhook processing
  - Tests check correct sequence number ordering and values
  - Not testing trivial rendering or implementation details
  - Not over-mocking or testing only mock calls

## Issues Found

### None - All Clean

This commit demonstrates excellent code quality with no violations of the defined bad code smell patterns.

## Positive Observations

1. **Type Safety Improvement**: Removing string conversions (`parseInt`, `String()`) eliminates potential runtime errors and makes the code more type-safe

2. **Code Simplification**: The changes reduce complexity by removing unnecessary type conversions:
   - Before: `String(lastSequence + index + 1)` (integer → string conversion)
   - After: `lastSequence + index + 1` (stays as integer)

3. **Database Integrity**: Adding `fileParallelism: false` to vitest config shows awareness of database state management and prevents race conditions

4. **Test Alignment**: Tests properly updated to match implementation changes, ensuring continued correctness

5. **Clear Documentation**: Commit message follows conventional commits format and clearly explains the relationship to PR #55

## Recommendations

### Optional Improvements

1. **Consider Sequential Test Strategy**: The `fileParallelism: false` setting affects all tests. Consider whether this is necessary globally or if specific test isolation strategies could be more targeted (e.g., using transactions, separate test databases, or better cleanup)

2. **Future Enhancement**: When adding a GET endpoint for agent events, refactor tests to use the API endpoint instead of direct database queries (per smell #12)

## Overall Assessment

**✅ PASS**

This commit receives a **PASS** rating with the following justification:

- **Zero violations** of any defined bad code smell patterns
- **Improved code quality** through type safety enhancements
- **Proper test coverage** with meaningful assertions
- **Good documentation** in commit message
- **Appropriate handling** of database concerns in tests

The changes are well-executed, maintain code quality standards, and properly align with the underlying schema changes. The addition of sequential test execution shows good judgment in handling database state.
