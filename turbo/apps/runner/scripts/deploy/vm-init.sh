# vm-init: VM initialization script
#
# This script runs as PID 1 when the VM boots. It:
# 1. Mounts the squashfs base filesystem (read-only) from /dev/vda
# 2. Mounts the ext4 overlay filesystem (read-write) from /dev/vdb
# 3. Creates an overlayfs combining both
# 4. Switches root to the overlay
# 5. Mounts virtual filesystems (/proc, /sys)
# 6. Starts vsock-agent with tini for signal handling
#
# Device mapping:
#   /dev/vda - squashfs base (read-only, shared across VMs)
#   /dev/vdb - ext4 overlay (read-write, per-VM)
#
