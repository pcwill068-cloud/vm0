description: Enable your agent to automatically commit research reports to GitHub repositories
---

Now let's take your research agent to the next level by making it automatically commit research reports to a GitHub repository. With VM0's `apps` field, you can easily add pre-installed tools like the GitHub CLI to your agent's environment.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- A GitHub account
- A test repository where the agent can commit reports, create one if you don't have it
- A GitHub personal access token with `content write` permission, you can create one at [github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens)

You should have also completed the previous sections of this tutorial.

## Step 1: Update vm0.yaml

Update your `vm0.yaml` to use the GitHub app and add the GitHub skill:

```yaml title="vm0.yaml"
version: "1.0"

agents:
  my-researcher:
    framework: claude-code
    apps:
      - github # [!code highlight]
    instructions: AGENTS.md
    environment:
      CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
    skills:
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/firecrawl
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/tavily
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/github # [!code highlight]
```

The key changes are:
- Added `apps: [github]` to include a container image with GitHub CLI pre-installed
- Added the GitHub skill to enable GitHub operations

<Callout type="info">
  The `apps` field automatically selects a container image with the specified tools pre-installed. Currently supported: `github` (includes GitHub CLI). You can also specify version tags like `github:dev` or `github:latest`.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Update Agent Instructions

Update your `AGENTS.md` to include GitHub workflow:

```markdown title="AGENTS.md"
# Deep Research Agent

You help me research topics by gathering information from multiple sources and creating a summary report.

## What to do

When I give you a research topic:

1. `gh repo clone your-username/your-repo` as working directory and use `gh auth setup-git` make sure we have write permission
2. Create a folder based on the research topic to keep things organized
3. Using tavily figure out 3-5 good sources to look at
4. Using firecrawl visit each source and grab the important info
5. For each source, write a research report about what you found from that source
6. Combine everything into one report called `report.md` that summarizes all the findings
7. git commit & push

That's it! Keep the files simple and readable.
```

The key changes are step 1 clones the GitHub repository as the working directory and sets up git authentication for write permission, so all research files are created inside the repo, and step 7 commits and pushes them to GitHub.

## Step 3: Compose Your Agent

Recompose your agent with the new configuration:

```bash
vm0 compose vm0.yaml
```

You'll see output showing the GitHub skill being added:

```
Uploading instructions: AGENTS.md
✓ Instructions uploaded: 1191fd33
Uploading 3 skill(s)...
  Downloading: https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/firecrawl
  ✓ Skill (unchanged): firecrawl (119bf88e)
  Downloading: https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/tavily
  ✓ Skill (unchanged): tavily (f1cc346f)
  Downloading: https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/github
  ✓ Skill uploaded: github (30aa39f6)

Skills require the following environment variables:

  Secrets:
    FIRECRAWL_API_KEY        <- firecrawl
    TAVILY_API_KEY           <- tavily
    GH_TOKEN                 (new) <- github

? Approve 1 new secret(s)? › (Y/n)
```

VM0 is asking you to approve the new `GH_TOKEN` secret required by the GitHub skill. Type `y` and press Enter to continue.

## Step 4: Run Your Agent

Now let's run the agent. Since we're using GitHub repository to store research reports, we don't need the artifact parameter:

```bash
vm0 run my-researcher "research the latest developments in WebAssembly for 2025"
```

You'll see an error asking for the GitHub token:

```
✗ Run preparation failed
  Missing required secrets: GH_TOKEN. Use '--secrets GH_TOKEN=<value>' to provide them.
```

Open your `.env` file and add the GitHub token:

```bash title=".env"
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-xxx
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-xxx
GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
```

Now run again:

```bash
vm0 run my-researcher "research the latest developments in WebAssembly for 2025"
```

After the agent finishes running, visit your GitHub repository. You should see the research report, similar to https://github.com/vm0-ai/tutorial-report/blob/main/webassembly-2025-developments/report.md

## What Just Happened?

You used the `apps: [github]` field to automatically get a container image with GitHub CLI pre-installed. The `apps` field is the simplest way to add pre-installed tools to your agent's environment - no custom Docker images or Dockerfiles required.

<Callout>
  This is optional. You can commit your changes if you want to save this milestone.

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat: add github app and auto-commit capability"
  ```
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Congratulations! The tutorial ends here. You've built a capable deep research agent. From here, you can visit [Model Selection](/docs/model-selection) to explore cost-effective model alternatives, or experiment with your `AGENTS.md` to customize the output format and agent behavior.
