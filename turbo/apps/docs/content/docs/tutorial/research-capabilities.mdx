title: Adding Research Capabilities
description: Enhance your agent with Firecrawl and Tavily for better research
---

Now let's give your research agent some superpowers by adding specialized tools for web research.

## Why Add These Tools?

The built-in `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` tools are great for basic tasks, but they have limitations. WebSearch returns snippets and may not always give you full content. WebFetch can struggle with JavaScript-heavy sites or complex page structures.

This is where specialized services come in:

**Firecrawl** is a web scraping service that turns any website into clean, LLM-ready markdown. It handles JavaScript rendering, removes navigation and ads, and extracts just the content you need.

**Tavily** is an AI-powered search API built specifically for LLMs. It understands context better than traditional search and returns highly relevant sources with clean summaries.

Together, they create a powerful workflow: Tavily finds the best sources, and Firecrawl extracts clean content from them.

## Prerequisites

You'll need API keys from both services:

- **Firecrawl API key** from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev) (500 credits/month free)
- **Tavily API key** from [tavily.com](https://tavily.com) (1,000 credits/month free)

You should have also completed the previous sections of this tutorial.

## Step 1: Add Skills to vm0.yaml

Open your `vm0.yaml` and add the skills section:

```yaml title="vm0.yaml"
version: "1.0"

agents:
  my-researcher:
    framework: claude-code
    instructions: AGENTS.md
    environment:
      CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
    skills:
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/firecrawl
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/tavily
```

The skills section tells VM0 to load these integrations when composing your agent.

## Step 2: Update Agent Instructions

Now update your `AGENTS.md` to use these new tools:

```markdown title="AGENTS.md"
# Deep Research Agent

You help me research topics by gathering information from multiple sources and creating a summary report.

## What to do

When I give you a research topic:

1. Create a folder based on the research topic to keep things organized
2. Using tavily figure out 3-5 good sources to look at
3. Using firecrawl visit each source and grab the important info
4. For each source, write a research report about what you found from that source
5. Combine everything into one report called `report.md` that summarizes all the findings

That's it! Keep the files simple and readable.
```

The key changes are explicitly telling the agent to use tavily for search and firecrawl for content extraction.

## Step 3: Compose Your Agent

Recompose your agent to include the new skills:

```bash
vm0 compose vm0.yaml
```

You'll see output showing the skills being downloaded and uploaded:

```
Uploading instructions: AGENTS.md
✓ Instructions uploaded: 15f0ffee
Uploading 2 skill(s)...
  Downloading: https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/firecrawl
  ✓ Skill (unchanged): firecrawl (119bf88e)
  Downloading: https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/tavily
  ✓ Skill uploaded: tavily (f1cc346f)

Skills require the following environment variables:

  Secrets:
    FIRECRAWL_API_KEY        (new) <- firecrawl
    TAVILY_API_KEY           (new) <- tavily

? Approve 2 new secret(s)? › (Y/n)
```

VM0 is asking you to approve the new secrets required by these skills. This is a security confirmation since the secrets are implicitly passed through the skills. Type `y` and press Enter to continue.

## Step 4: Run Your Agent

Let's test it out:

```bash
vm0 run my-researcher --artifact-name artifact "research the latest developments in WebAssembly for 2025"
```

You'll see an error asking for the API keys:

```
✗ Run preparation failed
  Missing required secrets: TAVILY_API_KEY, FIRECRAWL_API_KEY. Use '--secrets TAVILY_API_KEY=<value>' to provide them.
```

Open your `.env` file and add the API keys:

```bash title=".env"
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-xxx
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-xxx
```

Now run again:

```bash
vm0 run my-researcher --artifact-name artifact "research the latest developments in WebAssembly for 2025"
```

This time it should work! You'll see the agent:

1. Use Tavily to find relevant sources
2. Use Firecrawl to extract content from each source
3. Create individual research reports
4. Combine everything into a final report

The research quality will be noticeably better compared to using basic web tools.

## What Just Happened?

The skills system integrated Firecrawl and Tavily into your agent's capabilities. When you composed the agent, VM0:

1. Downloaded the skill definitions from GitHub
2. Built the `$HOME/.claude/skills` directory structure to mount into the sandbox
3. Injected the API keys from your environment into the sandbox securely

During execution, Claude Code could see these tools in its available toolkit and used them according to your instructions. The combination of AI-powered search and clean content extraction produced much higher quality research.

To learn more about how skills are mounted into the sandbox, see the [Volume documentation](/docs/core-concept/volume). For details on how environment variables and secrets work, check the [Environment Variables documentation](/docs/core-concept/environment-variable).

  This is optional. You can commit your changes if you want to save this milestone.

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat: add firecrawl and tavily skills to research agent"
  ```
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Your research agent is now much more capable! Next we'll try making the agent automatically commit research records to a GitHub repository. This requires providing git and github cli tools to the agent sandbox. We'll learn how to achieve this by customizing the container image.
