[Discord Webhooks](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook) allow sending messages to Discord channels without setting up a bot.

## Required Environment

| Name                  | Type   | Description                                               |
| --------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | secret | Webhook URL from Discord (Server Settings > Integrations) |

## Configuration

```yaml title="vm0.yaml"
version: "1.0"

agents:
  my-agent:
    framework: claude-code
    skills:
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/discord-webhook # [!code highlight]
```

## Run

Store your secret on the platform (recommended, one-time setup):

```bash
vm0 secret set DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL your-discord-webhook-url
```

Then run your agent - secret is automatically loaded:

```bash
vm0 run my-agent "send deployment notification to Discord"
```

<Callout type="info">
For CI/CD or temporary overrides, pass secrets at runtime: `--secrets DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=value`. See [Environment Variables](/docs/core-concept/environment-variable) for details.
