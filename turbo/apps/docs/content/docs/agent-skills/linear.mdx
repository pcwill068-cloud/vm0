[Linear](https://linear.app/) is a project management tool for software teams. This skill enables your agent to create issues, update statuses, and manage projects.

## Required Environment

| Name             | Type   | Description                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LINEAR_API_KEY` | secret | API key from [Linear Settings](https://linear.app/settings/api) |

## Configuration

```yaml title="vm0.yaml"
version: "1.0"

agents:
  my-agent:
    framework: claude-code
    skills:
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/linear # [!code highlight]
```

## Run

Store your secret on the platform (recommended, one-time setup):

```bash
vm0 secret set LINEAR_API_KEY your-linear-api-key
```

Then run your agent - secret is automatically loaded:

```bash
vm0 run my-agent "create an issue"
```

For CI/CD or temporary overrides, pass secrets at runtime: `--secrets LINEAR_API_KEY=value`. See [Environment Variables](/docs/core-concept/environment-variable) for details.
