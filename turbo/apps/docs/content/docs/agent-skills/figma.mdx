[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a collaborative design platform. Use the API to access design files, export images, and manage comments.

## Required Environment

| Name              | Type   | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FIGMA_API_TOKEN` | secret | Personal access token from [Figma Settings](https://www.figma.com/settings) |

## Configuration

```yaml title="vm0.yaml"
version: "1.0"

agents:
  my-agent:
    framework: claude-code
    skills:
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/figma # [!code highlight]
```

## Run

Store your secret on the platform (recommended, one-time setup):

```bash
vm0 secret set FIGMA_API_TOKEN your-figma-api-token
```

Then run your agent - secret is automatically loaded:

```bash
vm0 run my-agent "export frames from Figma file"
```
