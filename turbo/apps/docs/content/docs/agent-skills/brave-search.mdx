## Required Environment

| Name            | Type   | Description                                                              |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `BRAVE_API_KEY` | secret | API key from [Brave Search API](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/) |

## Configuration

```yaml title="vm0.yaml"
version: "1.0"

  my-agent:
    framework: claude-code
    skills:
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/brave-search # [!code highlight]
```

## Run

Store your secret on the platform (recommended, one-time setup):

```bash
vm0 secret set BRAVE_API_KEY your-brave-api-key
```

Then run your agent - secret is automatically loaded:

```bash
vm0 run my-agent "search for latest AI news"
```
