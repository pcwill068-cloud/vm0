[Axiom](https://axiom.co/) is a cloud-native observability platform for storing, querying, and analyzing log and event data at scale using APL (Axiom Processing Language).

## Required Environment

| Name                          | Type   | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AXIOM_API_TOKEN`             | secret | API token from [Axiom Settings](https://app.axiom.co/settings/api-tokens) |
| `AXIOM_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | secret | Personal access token for full account access (optional)                  |
| `AXIOM_ORG_ID`                | var    | Organization ID (required when using PAT)                                 |

## Configuration

```yaml title="vm0.yaml"
version: "1.0"

agents:
  my-agent:
    framework: claude-code
    skills:
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/axiom # [!code highlight]
```

## Run

```bash
vm0 run my-agent "query error logs from last hour" \
  --secrets AXIOM_API_TOKEN=xaat-xxx # [!code highlight]
```

## Example Instructions

```markdown title="AGENTS.md"
# Log Analysis Agent

You use Axiom to analyze application logs and events.

## Workflow

1. Receive log query requirements
2. Construct APL query for the dataset
3. Execute query and analyze results
4. Summarize findings and anomalies

## APL Query Examples

- Filter by level: `["logs"] | where level == "error"`
- Count by group: `["logs"] | summarize count() by service`
```

```markdown title="AGENTS.md"
# Metrics Ingestion Agent

You use Axiom to ingest metrics and events.

## Workflow

1. Collect metrics data from the application
2. Format data as JSON array
3. Ingest to the appropriate dataset
4. Verify ingestion success

## Guidelines

- Batch events for better performance
- Include timestamps in events
- Use appropriate dataset names
```
