[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) is a complete DevOps platform for managing projects, issues, merge requests, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Required Environment

| Name           | Type   | Description                                                 |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | secret | Personal access token with `api` scope from GitLab Settings |
| `GITLAB_HOST`  | var    | GitLab domain (e.g., `gitlab.com` or self-hosted)           |

## Configuration

```yaml title="vm0.yaml"
version: "1.0"

agents:
  my-agent:
    framework: claude-code
    skills:
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/gitlab # [!code highlight]
```

## Run

Store your secret on the platform (recommended, one-time setup):

```bash
vm0 secret set GITLAB_TOKEN your-gitlab-token
```

Then run your agent - secret is automatically loaded:

```bash
vm0 run my-agent "create an issue in GitLab"
```

<Callout type="info">
For CI/CD or temporary overrides, pass secrets at runtime: `--secrets GITLAB_TOKEN=value`. See [Environment Variables](/docs/core-concept/environment-variable) for details.
