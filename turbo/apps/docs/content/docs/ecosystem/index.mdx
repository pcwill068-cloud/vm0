---

VM0 agents don't have to stay in the terminal. Ecosystem integrations let you connect your agents to the platforms you already use, with more to come.

Once connected, your agent becomes a native part of that platform. Ask it a question, trigger a workflow, or have a conversation — all without leaving the tools you know.
