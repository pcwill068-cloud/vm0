description: Link VM0 agents to Slack and chat with them in any channel
---

The VM0 Slack integration brings your agents directly into Slack. Once connected, you can mention `@VM0` in any channel or send a direct message to interact with your agents through natural conversation.

## Use Cases

- **Team Q&A** — Link a knowledge-base agent and let anyone in the channel ask questions
- **Automated workflows** — Trigger agent tasks from Slack conversations without switching to the terminal
- **Collaborative debugging** — Share context in a thread and let the agent help investigate
- **Parallel task execution** — Kick off agent tasks in Slack while you continue other work

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| VM0 Account | Sign up at [vm0.ai](https://www.vm0.ai) if you don't have one |
| An Agent | Complete the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide to create your first agent |
| Slack Workspace | Admin access to [install the VM0 app](https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=9860643978390.10448672115104&scope=app_mentions:read,channels:history,channels:read,chat:write,commands,groups:history,im:history,im:write,reactions:write,users:read&user_scope=) in your workspace |

## Setup

### 1. Install the VM0 App in Slack

A workspace administrator must [install the VM0 app](https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=9860643978390.10448672115104&scope=app_mentions:read,channels:history,channels:read,chat:write,commands,groups:history,im:history,im:write,reactions:write,users:read&user_scope=) to the workspace. During installation, Slack will ask you to authorize the following permissions:

- Read messages in channels and DMs where VM0 is added
- Send messages and reactions
- Handle slash commands
- Read user information and shared files

### 2. Connect Your VM0 Account

After the app is installed, connect your VM0 account in Slack. You can do this either by running the slash command in any channel where VM0 is present:

```
/vm0 connect
```

Or by opening the VM0 App Home in Slack and clicking the **Connect** button.

Both options open a browser flow to complete the authentication.

### 3. Link an Agent

Link an agent from your VM0 account to your Slack workspace:

```
/vm0 agent link
```

This opens a dialog where you select an agent. If the agent requires a model provider, secrets, or environment variables (e.g. API keys), you'll be prompted to configure them during this step.

Once linked, the agent is available to you in any channel where `@VM0` is present.

You can also use [`/vm0 agent compose`](#slash-commands) to create an agent directly from a public GitHub URL, like [this Hacker News agent](https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-cookbooks/tree/main/examples/201-hackernews).
</Callout>

## How It Works

### Mention in Channels

Mention `@VM0` in any channel with your message.

```
@VM0 summarize the latest support tickets
```

A thinking reaction appears while the agent processes your request.

### Direct Messages

You can also DM the VM0 bot directly for private, one-on-one interactions. In DMs, all messages are routed to your linked agent automatically.

### Thread Context

When you mention `@VM0` in a thread, it gathers context from all messages in that thread. This lets the agent understand the full conversation and provide more relevant responses.

## Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/vm0 connect` | Connect your Slack account to VM0 |
| `/vm0 disconnect` | Disconnect your VM0 account |
| `/vm0 agent compose` | Compose an agent from a public GitHub URL (e.g. [this Hacker News agent](https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-cookbooks/tree/main/examples/201-hackernews)). <br/> The repository must contain a [`vm0.yaml`](/docs/reference/configuration/vm0-yaml) configuration file — see the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide for details on creating agents. |
| `/vm0 agent link` | Link an existing agent |
| `/vm0 agent unlink` | Unlink an agent |
| `/vm0 agent update` | Update agent configuration |
| `/vm0 help` | Show available commands |

## App Home

The App Home tab in Slack shows your connection status, linked agents, and quick-reference commands. Open it by clicking "VM0" in your Slack Apps section.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent not responding

1. Verify your VM0 account is connected — run `/vm0 connect`
2. Check that your agent is linked — run `/vm0 agent link`

### Authentication errors

1. Run `/vm0 disconnect` then `/vm0 connect` to re-link your account
2. Verify your VM0 account is active
