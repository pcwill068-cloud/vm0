description: Persistent storage for agent working directories
---

Artifacts provide persistent storage that maps to the CLI agent's working directory. Files created or modified by the agent are automatically saved and can be restored in future runs.

## How Artifacts Work

When you run an agent with `--artifact-name`:

1. **Before running** - vm0 loads the artifact into the agent's working directory
2. **After running** - vm0 persists any changes back to the artifact

This allows your agent to maintain state across multiple runs, building on previous work.

```bash
vm0 run my-agent "continue the project" --artifact-name my-project
```

## Managing Artifacts

You can also manage artifacts manually using the `vm0 artifact` commands.

### Initialize

Initialize an artifact in the current directory:

```bash
vm0 artifact init
```

This creates a `.vm0/storage.yaml` config file. The directory name becomes the artifact name.

### Push

Upload local files to the cloud:

```bash
vm0 artifact push
```

Options:

- `-f, --force` - Force upload even if content unchanged

### Pull

Download artifact from the cloud:

```bash
# Pull latest version
vm0 artifact pull

# Pull specific version
vm0 artifact pull abc123
```

### Status

Check the cloud artifact status:

```bash
vm0 artifact status
```

Shows version, file count, and size of the remote artifact.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Create a project directory
mkdir my-project && cd my-project

# Initialize as an artifact
vm0 artifact init

# Add some initial files
echo "# My Project" > README.md

# Push to cloud
vm0 artifact push

# Run agent with this artifact
vm0 run my-agent "set up a Python project" --artifact-name my-project

# Pull the agent's changes locally
vm0 artifact pull
```
