## An Analogy

Imagine a new colleague, Joseph, joins your team. Joseph is an experienced finance expert. To help him work effectively, the team sets up a computer for him with pre-installed software like web browsers and spreadsheets. Joseph has extensive experience using these tools and specialized knowledge in finance. Your team lead assigns Joseph a work plan to help grow the business.

This scenario has many parallels with a VM0 Agent:

<Mermaid chart={`flowchart LR
    subgraph joseph["Joseph at Work"]
        direction TB
        computer["Computer<br/><small>Pre-installed software</small>"]
        expertise["Finance Expertise<br/><small>Specialized knowledge</small>"]
        plan["Work Plan<br/><small>Tasks from team lead</small>"]
    end

    subgraph agent["VM0 Agent"]
        direction TB
        sandbox["Sandbox<br/><small>Runtime environment</small>"]
        skills["Skills<br/><small>Domain capabilities</small>"]
        instruction["Instruction<br/><small>Tasks in AGENTS.md</small>"]
    end

    computer -.-> sandbox
    expertise -.-> skills
    plan -.-> instruction

`} />

The **Agent Provider** (Claude Code or Codex) is a capable worker, and **Skills** give the agent specialized expertise in specific domains, just like the finance expertise Joseph has. The **Sandbox** is like Joseph's computer with pre-installed software. And **Instruction** is the work plan that tells the agent what to do.

## Sandbox

The Sandbox provides the runtime environment for your agent. It includes:

- The Agent Provider (Claude Code or Codex)
- System tools and dependencies
- Base configuration

VM0 prepares your sandbox with the appropriate runtime environment for your provider. Use the `apps` field to add pre-installed tools like GitHub CLI (e.g., `apps: [github]`).

## Skills & Instructions

When you run an agent, VM0 packages your skills and instructions and mounts them into the sandbox at the appropriate location for the agent provider (`~/.claude` for Claude Code, `~/.codex` for Codex).

- **[Instruction](/docs/core-concept/instructions)** - Defines what the agent should do (via `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`)
- **[Skills](/docs/core-concept/skills)** - Reusable packages that add domain-specific capabilities, like [Firecrawl](/docs/agent-skills/firecrawl), [Notion](/docs/agent-skills/notion), or [Create Slides](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/pptx)
