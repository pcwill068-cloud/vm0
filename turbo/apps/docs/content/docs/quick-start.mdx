## Installation

Install the VM0 CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @vm0/cli
```

Or use your preferred package manager: `pnpm add -g @vm0/cli` / `yarn global add @vm0/cli`

## Login

Authenticate with your VM0 account:

```bash
vm0 auth login
```

## Create Your First Agent

Create a new directory and initialize a VM0 agent:

```bash
mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
vm0 init
```

This creates two files:

- **[vm0.yaml](/docs/reference/vm0-yaml)** - Agent configuration file that defines the agent's provider and environment settings
- **AGENTS.md** - Instructions file that describes what the agent should do and how it should behave

## Initialize Token

Set up your Claude Code OAuth token:

```bash
claude setup-token
echo "CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=<your-token>" > .env
```

You can also use other model providers instead of Claude, like Moonshot (Kimi), MiniMax, DeepSeek, Z.AI (GLM), or OpenRouter. See [Model Selection](/docs/model-selection) for configuration options.

## Run Your Agent

Start the agent with a prompt:

```bash
vm0 cook "let's start working."
```

The `cook` command is a complete workflow that:
1. Prepares artifacts from your local files
2. Composes the agent using [`vm0.yaml`](/docs/reference/configuration/vm0-yaml) and [`AGENTS.md`](/docs/core-concept/instructions)
3. Executes the agent with your prompt

This command displays the agent's execution logs in real-time. When the agent finishes, any files it created or modified will be downloaded to the `artifact` directory in your project.
