title: Run & Debug Agent
description: Execute agents and manage sessions
---

Use `vm0 run` to execute your agent and manage ongoing sessions.

## Running an Agent

```bash
vm0 run <agent-name> "<prompt>"
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Run latest version
vm0 run my-agent "build a todo app"

# Run specific version
vm0 run my-agent:abc123 "build a todo app"
```

## Options

| Option                      | Description                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `--vars <KEY=value>`        | Pass variables for `${{ vars.xxx }}`  |
| `--secrets <KEY=value>`     | Pass secrets for `${{ secrets.xxx }}` |
| `--artifact-name <name>`    | Use persistent artifact storage       |
| `--artifact-version <hash>` | Use specific artifact version         |

### Passing Variables and Secrets

```bash
vm0 run my-agent "deploy to production" \
  --vars ENV=production \
  --secrets API_KEY=sk-xxx
```

See [Environment Variables](/docs/environment-variables) for more details.

### Using Artifacts

```bash
vm0 run my-agent "continue the project" --artifact-name my-project
```

See [Artifact](/docs/artifact) for more details.

## Session and Checkpoint

After each run, vm0 outputs two IDs:

- **Session ID** - References the latest conversation and artifact state
- **Checkpoint ID** - References a snapshot of conversation and artifact at that moment

```
  View agent logs:
    vm0 logs abc123

  Continue with session (latest conversation and artifact):
    vm0 run continue <session-id> "your next prompt"

  Resume from checkpoint (snapshotted conversation and artifact):
    vm0 run resume <checkpoint-id> "your next prompt"
```

## Continue vs Resume

### Continue

Use `vm0 run continue` to continue working with the **latest** state:

```bash
vm0 run continue <session-id> "add user authentication"
```

- Uses latest conversation history
- Uses latest artifact version
- Best for ongoing iterative work

### Resume

Use `vm0 run resume` to go back to a **snapshot** point:

```bash
vm0 run resume <checkpoint-id> "try a different approach"
```

- Uses snapshotted conversation history
- Uses snapshotted artifact version
- Best for branching or trying alternatives

## Debugging Multi-Step Workflows

For complex workflows, you can debug step by step using checkpoints.

**Example: A 3-step workflow**

Step 1 - Run the first step:

```bash
vm0 run my-agent "to step 1" --artifact-name my-project
# Outputs: checkpoint-id-1
```

Step 2 - Check the results, then continue:

```bash
# View logs from step 1
vm0 logs <run-id-1>

# Check artifact state
vm0 artifact pull

# Continue to step 2
vm0 run resume <checkpoint-id-1> "to step 2"
# Outputs: checkpoint-id-2
```

Step 3 - Repeat:

```bash
# View logs from step 2
vm0 logs <run-id-2>

# Continue to step 3
vm0 run resume <checkpoint-id-2> "to step 3"
```

This approach lets you:

- Observe the agent's progress at each step
- Inspect logs and artifact state between steps
- Retry a step with different prompts if needed
- Branch from any checkpoint to try alternative approaches

## Viewing Logs

After a run completes, view the full logs:

```bash
vm0 logs <run-id>
```

## Scheduled Run

For automated scheduled runs, use GitHub Actions with `vm0-ai/run-action`:

```yaml
name: Scheduled Run

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 18 * * *"

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Agent
        uses: vm0-ai/run-action@v1
        with:
          agent: my-agent
          prompt: "do the daily task"
          vm0-token: ${{ secrets.VM0_TOKEN }}
```

See [GitHub Actions](/docs/github-actions) for more details on setting up automated workflows.
