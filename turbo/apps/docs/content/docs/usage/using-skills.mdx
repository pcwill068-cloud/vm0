description: How to effectively use skills in your agent workflows
---

Skills extend your agent's capabilities by providing pre-built integrations with external services. This guide explains how to use skills effectively in your agent workflows.

## How Skills Work

When you run an agent with skills configured:

1. **Download**: VM0 downloads the skill from its GitHub URL
2. **Mount**: The skill is mounted at `~/.claude/skills/{skillName}/`
3. **Available**: The agent can use the skill's capabilities during execution

The agent automatically discovers available skills and uses them based on your instructions and prompts.

## Writing Instructions That Use Skills

Your agent instructions (`AGENTS.md`) should describe workflows that leverage your configured skills. The agent understands what each skill can do and will use them appropriately.

### Basic Pattern

```markdown title="AGENTS.md"
# Research Assistant

You are a research assistant that finds and summarizes information.

## Capabilities

- Use Firecrawl to scrape web pages
- Use Notion to save research notes
- Use Slack to share summaries with the team

## Workflow

1. Search for relevant sources on the topic
2. Scrape and analyze the content
3. Create a summary in Notion
4. Post highlights to #research channel in Slack
```

### Be Specific About Actions

Tell the agent what actions to take with each skill:

```markdown title="AGENTS.md"
# Daily News Digest

## Morning Routine

1. Fetch top stories from Hacker News
2. Scrape the top 5 articles using Firecrawl
3. Summarize key points from each article
4. Create a digest page in Notion under "Daily Digests"
5. Send the digest link to #news channel in Slack
```

## Combining Multiple Skills

Skills work together naturally. Configure all the skills you need and describe the workflow:

```yaml title="vm0.yaml"
version: "1.0"

agents:
  research-bot:
    framework: claude-code
    skills:
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/firecrawl
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/notion
      - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/slack
```

```bash
vm0 run research-bot "research AI agent frameworks and create a comparison" \
  --secrets FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-xxx \
  --secrets NOTION_API_KEY=secret_xxx \
  --secrets SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-xxx
```

## Runtime Prompts

When running your agent, your prompt guides what the agent does with its skills:

```bash
# Simple task
vm0 run my-agent "post today's metrics to #team-updates"

# Multi-step task
vm0 run my-agent "scrape the blog post at https://example.com/post, summarize it, and save to Notion"

# Conditional workflow
vm0 run my-agent "check Linear for bugs marked critical, if any exist, alert #engineering on Slack"
```

## Best Practices

### Match Skills to Instructions

Only configure skills your agent actually needs. If your instructions mention Slack, configure the Slack skill:

```yaml title="vm0.yaml"
skills:
  - https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills/tree/main/slack
```

### Provide Context in Instructions

Help the agent understand where and how to use each skill:

```markdown title="AGENTS.md"
## Output Destinations

- **Quick updates**: Post to Slack #updates channel
- **Detailed reports**: Create a new page in Notion under "Reports"
- **Data exports**: Save to Google Sheets "Weekly Data" spreadsheet
```

### Handle Credentials

Pass required credentials when running your agent:

```bash
vm0 run my-agent "sync data to sheets" \
  --secrets GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_ID=xxx \
  --secrets GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx \
  --secrets GOOGLE_SHEETS_REFRESH_TOKEN=xxx
```

See [Environment Variables](/docs/core-concept/environment-variable) for managing secrets.

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Found

If the agent reports it cannot find a skill:
- Verify the skill URL in `vm0.yaml` is correct
- Check the skill exists at [vm0-ai/vm0-skills](https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0-skills)

### Authentication Errors

If the agent fails to authenticate with a service:
- Verify all required secrets are passed via `--secrets`
- Check the credential values are correct
- Review the skill's documentation for required environment variables

### Skill Not Used

If the agent doesn't use a configured skill:
- Make your instructions more explicit about when to use the skill
- Mention the skill by name in your prompt
- Verify the skill is listed in your `vm0.yaml`

## Next Steps

- Browse available skills in [Agent Skills](/docs/agent-skills)
- Learn about [Instructions](/docs/core-concept/instructions) for detailed workflow design
- See [Environment Variables](/docs/core-concept/environment-variable) for credential management
