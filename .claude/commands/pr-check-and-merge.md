# PR Check and Merge Command

Automated PR pipeline monitoring, issue fixing, and merging workflow.

## Usage

```
/pr-check-and-merge [pr-id]
```

## Parameters

- `pr-id`: (Optional) GitHub PR number. If not provided, uses the current branch's PR

## Workflow

When this command is executed, perform the following steps in order:

### Step 1: Identify Target PR

1. If `pr-id` is provided, use that PR
2. Otherwise, get the current branch using `git branch --show-current`
3. Find the PR for current branch: `gh pr list --head {branch} --json number --jq '.[0].number'`
4. If no PR found, exit with error

### Step 2: Wait and Check Pipeline Status

Use the **pr-pipeline-monitor** agent to wait for pipeline and check status:

```typescript
await Task({
  description: "Monitor PR pipeline",
  prompt: `Monitor PR #${pr_id} pipeline status.`,
  subagent_type: "pr-pipeline-monitor"
});
```

### Step 3: Handle Result

Based on the agent's result:
- **All passing**: Continue to merge step
- **Failures detected**: Proceed to fix attempts
- **Still running**: Agent will retry up to 30 times (~30 min), then report timeout

### Step 4: Fix Detected Issues

Based on failure types, attempt automatic fixes:

#### For Lint Failures (if output contains "lint" and "fail"):
1. Navigate to turbo directory: `cd /workspaces/vm0/turbo`
2. Run formatter: `pnpm format`
3. If changes detected:
   - Stage changes: `git add -A`
   - Commit: `git commit -m "fix: auto-format code"`
   - Push: `git push`
4. Go back to Step 2 (re-run agent)

#### For Test Failures (if output contains "test" and "fail"):
1. Navigate to turbo directory: `cd /workspaces/vm0/turbo`
2. Run tests locally: `pnpm test`
3. Report whether tests pass locally or need manual fix
4. Note: If tests pass locally but fail in CI, it may be an environment issue

#### For Type Check Failures (if output contains "type" or "check-types" and "fail"):
1. Navigate to turbo directory: `cd /workspaces/vm0/turbo`
2. Run type checks: `pnpm check-types`
3. Report results (manual fix usually required)

After any successful fix:
- Reset retry counter
- Go back to Step 2 (re-run agent)
- Re-check pipeline status

### Step 5: Final Verification

After fixes (or if no fixes needed):
1. If still failing after 3 retry attempts, exit with error
2. If passing, proceed to merge

### Step 6: Merge the PR

If all checks pass, execute merge workflow:

1. Merge using squash strategy: `gh pr merge {pr-id} --squash --delete-branch`
2. After successful merge:
   - Switch to main: `git checkout main`
   - Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
   - Confirm on latest main

## Configuration

- **Pipeline monitoring**: See pr-pipeline-monitor agent configuration
- **Fix wait**: 60 seconds after pushing fixes

## Error Conditions

Exit with error if:
- No PR exists for current branch
- Pipeline checks fail after all retry attempts
- Unable to find turbo directory for fixes
- Merge operation fails

## Success Criteria

Command succeeds when:
- All pipeline checks pass (with or without fixes)
- PR is successfully merged
- Branch switched back to main

## Example Output

```

## Notes

- This command combines monitoring, fixing, and merging into one workflow
- Designed for the project's specific CI/CD setup
- Automatically handles common issues that can be fixed programmatically
- Uses squash merge to keep main branch history clean
- Preserves commit messages in squashed commit
- Uses pr-pipeline-monitor agent to handle the waiting/polling
